v1 - First iteration
  - Using running code from project as a base
  - Sensor code is under the Stage; consider moving it
  - Things learned:
      - Use join(S1, EV3TOUCH) instead of join(S1, TOUCH).
          - (Prepend sensor types with EV3 when using EV3 sensors.)
      - Sensor setup should all go under the READY broadcast
      - Specify sensor types before the SETUP broadcast

v2
  - Moved update loop to the touch sensor sprite
